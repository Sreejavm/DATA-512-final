## Abstract
Coronavirus has changed our lives since March and has been on the significant events of the 21st century. The infection rates and associate deaths have been increasing and continuing to impact our lives. This analysis is focused on find answer to questions that could help us to plan our lives better, especially in adapting ourselves in these adverse situations. [Data to be used](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) - OurWorldInData maintains a public database of all infections and deaths around of the world in daily based. The dataset also include population of the list of countries being analyzed. The dataset provide by OurWorldInData is openly accessible and is licensed under Creative Commons License [![License: CC0-1.0](https://licensebuttons.net/l/zero/1.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This project will focus on understanding how different countries were able to control the spread of covid and whether we became better and handling and treating the virus.

## Research Questions
1. How does population of a country affect the infection rate?
2. Are we better prepared to handle/treat coronavirus now?
3. Is infection rate similiar across countries with high infection?

## Methodology

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
I'd like to begin by exploring the dataset to analyze various trends and patterns in the dataset provided. This would help us identify countries of high interest with respect to our analysis. Based on the exploratory analysis, I would also like to append research questions that will be interesting to answer. In addition, this would also provide a good starting point to familiarize with the dataset and analyze accordingly

2. Data Analysis
Using the populations data provided, a hypothesis would be tested to see if higher population leads to more infection rate. Comparisons will be made on how the differences in mortality has varied over time in different countries and whether mortality has improved which would be an indicator for betting procedures and treatment. An in depth analysis would be performed to answer various questions. A regression model would be used to estimate infection rate across a highly infection country of choice and would be used to identify how the models fits on dataset of other countries. A regression model is chose as it is effective is identifying relationship between features and their relavence in predictions.

3. Visualizing predictions
In this part, the various analysis and the research questions analyzed above will be presented in form of visualizations.


## Project Structure

- ./data-512-final/code/covidAnalysis.ipynb -> Final project report and code 

- ./data-512-final/data/owid-covid-data.csv -> dataset used

- ./data-512-final/output -> ouptput jpeg files that are produced by the code

## Conclusion
The spread of coronavirus can be associated with political, economical and social aspects of these countries as they play a key role in the spread of the virus.

In addition, more data on how following guidelines such as using face masks, maintaining social distancing and lockdown helped control the pandemic

While this research focussed mostly on the total cased and the mortality associated with different countries, Iâ€™d like to explore more on the aspects of how treatment conditions and social regulation helped control the various aspects of pandemic
