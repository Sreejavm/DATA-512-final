# DATA-512 final project

## Overview
Coronavirus has changed our lives since March and has been on the significant events of the 21st century. The infection rates and associate deaths have been increasing and continuing to impact our lives. This analysis is focused on find answer to questions that could help us to plan our lives better, especially in adapting ourselves in these adverse situations

## Dataset
[Data to be used](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) - OurWorldInData maintains a public database of all infections and deaths around of the world in daily based. The dataset also include population of the list of countries being analyzed. The dataset provide by OurWorldInData is openly accessible and is licensed under Creative Commons License.

## Research Questions

#### 1. How does population of a country affect the infection rate?
#### 2. Are we better prepared to handle/treat coronavirus now?
#### 3. Is infection rate similiar across countries with high infection?

## Background/ Related work
Various study has been done on coronavirus and its impact. [This study](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/urban-density-not-linked-to-higher-coronavirus-infection-rates-and-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-death-rates.html) analyzes how urban density is related to infection rates. It found that urban density is not directly related to infection rate. Denser counties also had lower death rates due to more access to medicine and treatment.

[The Analysis](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) done here by John Hopkins university analyses. It delineates how fatality rates varies across different countries. Though this had produced neat ways to take a look and compare different countries, it does not makes any inferences. [The research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73777-8) done here tries to model on the coronavirus data and infers that the age difference suggests no large difference of susceptibility by age.

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
I'd like to begin by exploring the dataset to analyze various trends and patterns in the dataset provided. This would help us identify countries of high interest with respect to our analysis. Based on the exploratory analysis, I would also like to append research questions that will be interesting to answer. In addition, this would also provide a good starting point to familiarize with the dataset and analyze accordingly

### 2. Data Analysis
Using the populations data provided, a hypothesis would be tested to see if higher population leads to more infection rate. Comparisons will be made on how the differences in mortality has varied over time in different countries and whether mortality has improved which would be an indicator for betting procedures and treatment. An in depth analysis would be performed to answer various questions. A regression model would be used to estimate infection rate across a highly infection country of choice and would be used to identify how the models fits on dataset of other countries. A regression model is chose as it is effective is identifying relationship between features and their relavence in predictions.

### 3. Visualizing predictions
In this part, the various analysis and the research questions identified will be answered using visualizations.
